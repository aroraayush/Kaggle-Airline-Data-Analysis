# Glossary:

- **Taxi Out:** The flight attendants make sure the cabin is ready for takeoff and do conduct the emergency brief before takeoff. The pilots start the engines and request permission to taxi. While it seems that this is a relatively easy phase of your flight, its' anything but, especially when it is a very busy airport, a lot of aircraft taxing around, maybe reduced visibility. This time taken is called Taxi Out.
- **Taxi In:** Similar to Taxi Out, there is a definite amount of time from the airplane landing on the runway till the time it rests at the final stop before passengers are allowed to move out of the plan. This time taken is called Taxi In.
- **ICAO Code:** The ICAO airport code or location indicator is a four-letter code designating aerodromes around the world. (not using this one)
- **IATA Code:** An IATA airport code, also known as an IATA location identifier, IATA station code or simply a location identifier, is a three-letter geocode designating many airports and metropolitan areas around the world, defined by the International Air Transport Association (IATA)
